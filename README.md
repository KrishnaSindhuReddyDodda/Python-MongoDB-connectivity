# Python-MongoDB-connectivity
NO SQL project with Python connectivity


    Front End is related to Electronic cart. This database stores the product details like Model number, Price of the product, year of manufacture, size etc. Employee details are stored in the employee database for payroll processing. This database stores the details like Employee name, employee id, bank name and account number etc. Payment details are stored in a separate database. This includes payment details like, payment id, bank name, card number and payment type.
    To create connection between python and MongoDB database, we first need to have Pymongo driver. In this project if we update a query in back end i.e, python then it automatically updates in front end and gives desired result on retrieving.
